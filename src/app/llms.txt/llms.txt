Clipify is a Twitch overlay service that automatically plays selected Twitch clips on a live stream using browser-source overlays. It is designed to replace static “break”, “starting soon”, or “AFK” screens with engaging, dynamic content that keeps viewers watching instead of leaving the stream.

A common problem during live streams is viewer drop-off when a streamer goes AFK and shows a static image or countdown screen. New viewers who arrive during this time often leave immediately because nothing is happening. Clipify solves this by continuously playing highlights from the channel, giving viewers something entertaining to watch even when the streamer is away.

By showing clips instead of a static screen, Clipify:
- Entertains existing viewers during breaks
- Prevents new viewers from bouncing when they join mid-break
- Showcases the best moments of the channel automatically
- Keeps the stream feeling alive at all times

---

Clipify works entirely through browser-source overlays:

- Each overlay is accessed via a unique URL.
- The streamer adds this URL as a browser source in streaming software (such as OBS Studio, Streamlabs, or similar tools).
- No plugins, extensions, or local installations are required.
- Once added, the overlay runs automatically.

The overlay can be placed on a dedicated “Break”, “AFK”, “Starting Soon”, or “Ending” scene, or anywhere the streamer chooses.

Clip playback behavior:

- Clips play automatically and sequentially.
- Playback requires no manual interaction once configured.
- Eligible clips can be filtered by:
  - Clips created today
  - All-time clips
  - Featured clips only
- These filters determine which clips are eligible for playback in each overlay.

If no clips match the selected filters, the overlay remains idle until clips become available again.

---

Overlays and layout:

- Each overlay has its own configuration.
- Overlays can be reused across multiple scenes.
- Pro users can create multiple overlays with different purposes (for example, one for short breaks and one for long AFK periods).
- This allows streamers to tailor clip behavior depending on the context of the break.

Viewer engagement and Channel Points:

Clipify integrates with Twitch Channel Points to actively increase engagement and retention.

- Viewers earn Channel Points simply by watching the stream.
- These Channel Points can be spent to interact with Clipify.
- Viewers can redeem Channel Points to trigger clip playback.
- This turns passive watching into active participation.

Because viewers continue earning Channel Points during breaks, they are incentivized to stay instead of leaving. The ability to spend points on clips further reinforces engagement, making breaks feel interactive rather than idle.

Channel Points integration helps:
- Increase average watch time
- Improve viewer retention during breaks
- Encourage chat activity
- Reward loyal viewers for staying on the stream

Channel Points integration is available on the Pro plan.
