		title: "How does the Clipify referral program work?",
		content: "After joining, you receive your personal referral link. When someone upgrades to a paid Clipify plan through your link, you earn a recurring commission for as long as they stay subscribed.",
	},
	{
		title: "How does tracking work?",
		content: "Tracking uses a 30 day cookie. If someone visits Clipify through your referral link, the cookie remembers your code. If they upgrade during this time, the referral is credited to you.",
	},
	{
		title: "What counts as a valid referral?",
		content: "A valid referral is when a new user clicks your referral link and upgrades to a paid Clipify plan within 30 days. Self-referrals or using multiple accounts to generate referrals are not allowed.",
	},
	{
		title: "When are commissions added to my account?",
		content: "Commissions first appear as pending. After a 7 day delay, they become payable and are counted toward your next payout.",
	},
	{
		title: "Why didn't I receive a commission?",
		content: "This usually happens when tracking could not be completed. Common reasons include cookie blockers, deleted cookies, switching devices, not using your correct referral link, or the upgrade being refunded or flagged for review.",
	},
	{
		title: "Where can I see my referral activity?",
		content: "Your partner dashboard shows your clicks, your current balance, and your upcoming payouts. It does not show signups for privacy reasons.",
	},
	{
		title: "How do payouts work?",
		content: "Once your payable balance reaches the minimum threshold shown in your dashboard, you can request a payout. Payouts follow a regular schedule and require accurate payment details.",
	},
	{
		title: "What promotional methods are not allowed?",
		content: "Spam, misleading claims, fake traffic, aggressive outreach, or promoting Clipify alongside illegal or harmful content are not allowed. Honest recommendations and sharing with your audience are encouraged.",
	},
	{
		title: "Can my affiliate account be suspended?",
		content: "Only if there is harmful, abusive, or fraudulent activity. For normal creators this never happens. You can also leave the program anytime by simply stopping promotion.",
	},
